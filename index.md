I'm a PhD student in linguistics at McGill University. My research focuses mainly on formal semantics, pragmatics and syntax. In general though, I am interested in using formal methods in order to analyze the logical and mathematical aspects of natural language. I am also interested in applying computational methods to the study of semantics and, more generally, human cognition as it pertains to language.
